# Tic-Tac-Toe
A simple web-based XO (Tic-Tac-Toe) game built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Two players take turns marking X and O on a 3×3 grid. The first to align three marks wins; otherwise, it’s a draw. Clean UI, responsive design, and easy to play—great for practicing front-end basics!

Tic Tac Toe is a classic two-player game developed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This project provides an interactive, browser-based version where two players take turns marking X and O on a 3×3 grid. The first player to align three marks in a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal row wins. If all cells are filled without a winner, the game ends in a draw.

This project is a great example of DOM manipulation, event handling, and simple game logic implemented in pure JavaScript, with a clean and responsive UI using CSS. It's perfect for beginners looking to understand basic front-end development concepts.
